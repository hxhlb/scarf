## Observations
- [current-target] Scarf v2.10 targets Hermes v0.15.0 (v2026.5.28, 'The Velocity Release'). v0.14.0 keeps the full v2.9 surface; all versions v0.6.0 through v0.15.0 are verified. Older hosts degrade gracefully #target
- [philosophy] Every release-gated UI surface is capability-gated via HermesCapabilities flags. Pre-target hosts must render byte-identical to prior Scarf versions — never throw on unknown CLI subcommands #gating
- [flag-grouping] Group HermesCapabilities flags at the top of the file by introducing release: `MARK: v0.14 (v2026.5.16) flags`, `MARK: v0.15 (v2026.5.28) flags`, etc. #convention
- [verification] Verify exact flag/config/wire shapes against the tagged Hermes source (e.g. `v2026.5.28`) BEFORE implementation — flags like HERMES_INFERENCE_MODEL silently no-op for ACP because `_make_agent` doesn't consult them #pitfalls
- [keep-in-sync] On every Hermes bump, reconcile ModelCatalogService.{overlayOnlyProviders, modelAliases, demotedProviders, imageGenModels, providerDisplayNameOverrides} against hermes_cli/{providers.py, models.py, xai_retirement.py}; reconcile platform roster against plugins/platforms/ + gateway/platforms/; reconcile search/TTS backend lists #maintenance
- [schema] state.db schema has been unchanged since v0.11 (added messages.reasoning_content + sessions.api_call_count). v0.12/v0.13/v0.14/v0.15 require no DB migration. Scarf reads state.db and parses CLI output from `hermes status`, `hermes doctor`, `hermes tools`, `hermes sessions`, `hermes gateway`, `hermes pairing` with automatic schema detection for backward compatibility #schema
- [automatic-gains] Most v0.15 work (run_agent.py refactor, cold-start perf, promptware defense, session_search rebuild, Ink TUI, web dashboard, Docker s6, API-server REST) is server-side and benefits Scarf transparently with no code change #server-side

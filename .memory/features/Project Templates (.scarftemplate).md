## Observations
- [format] .scarftemplate is a zip containing: template.json (manifest with id/name/version/contents claim), README.md (preview), AGENTS.md (REQUIRED — Linux Foundation cross-agent instructions standard, every template is agent-portable), dashboard.json, optional instructions/ (CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md/.cursorrules/.github/copilot-instructions.md), optional skills/<name>/ (installed to ~/.hermes/skills/templates/<slug>/), optional cron/jobs.json (registered with `[tmpl:<id>] …` prefix, immediately paused), optional memory/append.md (appended to MEMORY.md between scarf-template:<id>:begin/end markers) #format
- [services] ProjectTemplateService (inspect + validate + plan), ProjectTemplateInstaller (execute plan), ProjectTemplateExporter (build from project), ProjectTemplateUninstaller (reverse via lock file). UI in Features/Templates/. Deep links via TemplateURLRouter + scarfApp.swift onOpenURL #services
- [deep-link] scarf://install?url=<https URL> and file:// URLs for .scarftemplate files trigger install flow #url-scheme
- [lock-file] <project>/.scarf/template.lock.json is written after every install and drives uninstall. Only files in lock.projectFiles are removed — user-added files (e.g. sites.txt) preserved. If every file in dir was template-installed, dir is removed; otherwise dir stays. Skills namespace removed wholesale (isolated). Cron jobs removed via `hermes cron remove <id>`. Memory block stripped between markers, rest of MEMORY.md intact #uninstall
- [security-rule] Templates MUST NOT write to config.yaml, auth.json, sessions, or any credential path — v1 installer refuses. Preview sheet is load-bearing: user's only trust boundary is that the sheet is honest about everything about to be written #security
- [no-undo] No 'undo' for uninstall — destructive. Re-install means running install flow again #semantics

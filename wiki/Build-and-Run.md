# Build and Run

Scarf is one Xcode project with **two app targets**: `scarf` (the macOS app) and `scarf mobile` (ScarfGo, iOS). Both targets share three local SwiftPM packages (`ScarfCore`, `ScarfIOS`, `ScarfDesign`) and pull in Sparkle (Mac auto-update) + Citadel (iOS pure-Swift SSH) as remote dependencies. No CocoaPods, no Carthage, no submodules.

## Prerequisites

- **macOS 14.6+ (Sonoma)** on the dev machine.
- **Xcode 16.0+**.
- **Hermes** at `~/.hermes/` (so the local Mac window has something to point at — see [First Run](First-Run)).
- For iOS: **Xcode iOS 18.0 simulator** (or a real iPhone running iOS 18+) and a Hermes-running host you can SSH to from the simulator.

## Open in Xcode

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awizemann/scarf.git
cd scarf
open scarf/scarf.xcodeproj
```

The project uses `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup` — Xcode auto-discovers any new file you drop into the source tree. You don't need to manually add files to the target.

Build with ⌘B; run with ⌘R.

## Build from the command line

### Mac scheme (`scarf`)

Debug build:

```bash
xcodebuild -project scarf/scarf.xcodeproj -scheme scarf -configuration Debug build
```

Universal release build (matches what the release script produces):

```bash
xcodebuild -project scarf/scarf.xcodeproj -scheme scarf \
  -configuration Release \
  -arch arm64 -arch x86_64 ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO build
```

#### Without an Apple Developer account

`scripts/local-build.sh` (added in v2.7.1) wraps an unsigned single-arch Debug build for contributors who don't have a signing certificate. It detects arm64 / x86_64, verifies xcode-select / xcrun / xcodebuild are present, probes the Metal toolchain (offers an interactive install on a TTY, errors cleanly on CI), resolves Swift packages, and builds with `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`. Optional one-touch `ditto` to `/Applications/scarf.app` on explicit y/N. See [`BUILDING.md`](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/blob/main/BUILDING.md) in the repo for the full prerequisites list.

```bash
./scripts/local-build.sh
```

### iOS scheme (`scarf mobile`)

Debug build for the simulator (no physical device needed):

```bash
xcodebuild -project scarf/scarf.xcodeproj -scheme "scarf mobile" \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination "generic/platform=iOS Simulator" build
```

The iOS target is iPhone-only as of v2.5: `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = 1`, `SUPPORTS_MACCATALYST = NO`, `SUPPORTS_MAC_DESIGNED_FOR_IPHONE_IPAD = NO`.

## Swift 6 concurrency

The project compiles with strict concurrency on. Two non-negotiables ([detail in CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/blob/main/CLAUDE.md)):

- `@MainActor` is the default isolation. Services use `nonisolated` async methods and route results back to MainActor for UI updates.
- All closures captured by `Task`, `Task.detached`, or `withCheckedThrowingContinuation` must be `@Sendable`. Don't capture non-Sendable types across concurrency boundaries.

## What to look at first

1. [`scarfApp.swift`](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/blob/main/scarf/scarf/scarfApp.swift) — Mac app entry point, multi-window setup, `ContextBoundRoot` injecting the `ServerContext` and friends.
2. [`Navigation/AppCoordinator.swift`](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/blob/main/scarf/scarf/Navigation/AppCoordinator.swift) — single source of truth for Mac navigation.
3. [`Models/ServerContext.swift`](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/blob/main/scarf/Packages/ScarfCore/Sources/ScarfCore/Models/ServerContext.swift) — the unified handle to a Hermes install (used by both targets).
4. [`Transport/`](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/tree/main/scarf/Packages/ScarfCore/Sources/ScarfCore/Transport) (LocalTransport + SSHTransport) and [`ScarfIOS/CitadelServerTransport.swift`](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/blob/main/scarf/Packages/ScarfIOS/Sources/ScarfIOS/CitadelServerTransport.swift) — the three transport implementations.
5. Any feature module under [`scarf/Features/`](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/tree/main/scarf/scarf/Features) for the Mac MVVM-F shape, or under [`Scarf iOS/`](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/tree/main/scarf/Scarf%20iOS) for the iOS equivalents.
6. [`ScarfGoTabRoot.swift`](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/blob/main/scarf/Scarf%20iOS/App/ScarfGoTabRoot.swift) — iOS root, 5-tab navigation, ServerContext wiring.

## Running tests

Mac target tests:

```bash
xcodebuild test -project scarf/scarf.xcodeproj -scheme scarf
```

ScarfCore SwiftPM tests (the bulk of v2.5 coverage — 14 test suites):

```bash
swift test --package-path scarf/Packages/ScarfCore
```

See [Testing](Testing) for the full inventory.

## Releasing

The Mac release runs through `./scripts/release.sh <version>` — don't invoke `xcodebuild archive` / `notarytool` / `gh release create` by hand. The iOS release is a separate Xcode Archive + App Store Connect upload (see [`releases/v<ver>/TESTFLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md`](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/blob/main/releases/v2.5.0/TESTFLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md) and [`APP_STORE_METADATA.md`](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/blob/main/releases/v2.5.0/APP_STORE_METADATA.md)). See [Release Process](Release-Process).
